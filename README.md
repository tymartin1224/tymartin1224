Hi my name is Tyler Martin and I'm studying and working to become a software engineer. I'm interested in a multitude of languages and would consider myself a full-stack developer
who understands the front and back-end but isn't a master of either. I'm searching for my first full-time position in software development to continue to build my skills and
become a better developer.

If you have any notes, or would like to reach me, my email is tyler.martin1@yahoo.com.
